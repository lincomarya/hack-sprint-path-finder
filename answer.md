4) Checking Git status:- git log
4) created answer.md : Touch answer.md

step 2: (connecting to the ssh Network )

password-(as provided by the community)

step 3: (aprroch to solve the problem)
ls - To lis all the dicectory peresent in the machine 

1) found dir name college 
2)cd college (to change the directory)
3)ls (to check the items in college
4)cat readme.txt (To read the text in file )
5)cd Hostel (as written in the readme.txt in college directory)
6)again found readme.txt :- cat readme.txt(to see the content)
7)cd sqrt
8)Founded a gpg file (Basically gpg is used to encrypt the data)
9)To decrypt gpg file we use the command gpg File_name
10)gpg readme..txt
11)gpg -d readme.txt.gpg (To decrypt the gpg file) the key was 4 (answer t=of the duck riddle )
12)change dir to '2ndyear'
13)gpg -d readme.txt (password - : linustorvalsslavrotsunil)
14)changed directory to /college/depts/ (as instructed)
15)cat readme (to read the file in that directory)
16)cd cs/2ndyear
17)gpg -d readme.txt.gpg (password : - Tdngnrngnfgllcyr29)
18)cd dbms (as instruction provided)
19)gpg -d readme.txt(password -ate)
20)change directory to vlsilab as instructed 
21)gpg -d readme.txt.gpg (password: 10239)
22)visit /college/depts/cs/2ndyear/thermlab directory as written in instruction 
23)gpg -d readme.txt.gpg (password:- 76105110991111099651141219719052022)
